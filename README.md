## Git vs. GitHub
###Git  
Git is version control and as said in the name, it allows you to be able to save diiferent versions of code on easy access. Git allows you to take snapshots of code and keeps track of the changes youve done to your files with each snapshot.  
###Github  
Github is set up in the cloud. That means that code that you create is stored in the cloud and your able to colaborate withothers not only on yoru code but with others aswell.  
###Difference?  
The difference between both is that in order to use Github you NEED Git. Git is intended to use be used for solo work and Github is great for colaboratin work. When saving code Github stores it in the cloud as where Git stores your snapshots of code in your local machine that your using.

## Initial Setup  
A [**Github Account**](https://github.com) and a [**Cloud 9 Account**](https://c9.com) is needed.

Once you have created your Github account now we have to set up the SSH key, which connects your local machine(c9 or nitrous) to your remote(Github).  

 1. Click profile icon on the upper right hand corner  
 2. Go to settings  
 3. Click the SSH key tab  
 4. Click add SSH key and title the remote whatever your local machine is called   
 5. On the SSH Key for cloud 9 you click on the settings icon on your home page  
 6. Click on the SSH key tab and copy and paste the Default SSH key on your Github key box  
 7. Now click Add Key  
 
**Keep in mind** unless you signed up for Cloud 9 with your github account you should:  
1. git init (Initializes git in your local machine)  
2. git config --global user.name "First Last"  
git config --global user.name "username@email.com" (the e-mail address you used to sign up for github)
