## Git vs. GitHub
###Git  
Git is version control and as said in the name, it allows you to be able to save diiferent versions of code on easy access. Git allows you to take snapshots of code and keeps track of the changes youve done to your files with each snapshot.  
###Github  
Github is set up in the cloud. That means that code that you create is stored in the cloud and your able to colaborate withothers not only on yoru code but with others aswell.  
###Difference?  
The difference between both is that in order to use Github you NEED Git. Git is intended to use be used for solo work and Github is great for colaboratin work. When saving code Github stores it in the cloud as where Git stores your snapshots of code in your local machine that your using.
